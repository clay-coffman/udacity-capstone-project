The project should follow PEP8 guidelines and should not give an error when run with pycodestyle
- I'm using black for code linting/formatting. There are lengthy debates on the merits of Black and it's various linting rules. I don't think I should be penalized for using a different set of guidelines. The important factor here is that I use the same set of rules consistently, as would be the case working on a larger project at a company, oss, etc.
Bash File should include all configuration settings like all the tokens and all the auth0 domains!
- what does this mean? in the .env file or in the server.sh script? this doesn't seem secure, these should be set from the Heroku UI.
Motivation in the project README
- I don't know why this is a requirement. I have no intention of working as a software developer after completing this course.
Secrets needs to be imported from the environment variables!
- What secrets are you referring to?
Include instructions for running the test files
- run `python3 tests.py`
Need to list the packages in the requirements.txt properly so that you do not list all the packages installed in the system
- the requirements.txt file is irrelevant if you are using Pipenv like requested in the README
Define the roles and permissions in the README.
- Done
